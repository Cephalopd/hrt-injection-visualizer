A free, web-based tool to assist individuals in calculating hormone injection dosage and visualizing the specific plunger position on a syringe.

**Live Demo:** [Insert your GitHub Pages URL here after deployment]

## 🎯 Goal
To reduce "math anxiety" and potential dosage errors for people self-injecting hormones. This tool provides a clear, visual representation of where the plunger should stop for a specific dose and concentration.

## ✨ Features
* **Reactive Calculation:** Instantly calculates draw volume based on Dose (mg) and Concentration (mg/mL).
* **Dynamic Visualizer:** An SVG syringe that fills up in real-time.
* **Zoom Lens:** A magnifying glass view to help users see exactly which tick mark aligns with their dose.
* **Mobile-First:** Designed with large touch targets and decimal keypads for phone use.
* **Privacy Focused:** No backend. No cookies. All data is stored locally on the user's device (`localStorage`).

## 🛠️ Technology
* **HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript**
* **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** for the rendering engine.
* **No dependencies:** Lightweight and fast.
